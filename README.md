# v4l2-opencv-test

Playing with v4l2 and opencv;

This is about trying to get frames from a CSI camera plugged into a Nano and then MATtify those frames to be able to play with them on opencv.
Reason to  do this is to find alternatives to gstreamer and libargus, let's see where this goes.

 -1 First screen capture: v4l2_screen_capture.c  DONE
 
 -2 Convert raw pic to jpeg or something (debayer and compress): NOT DONE
